A self review of older code is conducted by myself above. The original code submission is found here [Version 1.0](https://github.com/Eclan/NewHorizons/edit/main/PortScanV1.0.py) along with the updated [Version1.1](https://github.com/Eclan/NewHorizons/edit/main/PortScanV1.1.py).

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
